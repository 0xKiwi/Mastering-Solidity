# Mastering-Solidity
A smorgasbord of essential information to help educate about the inner workings of Solidity and the EVM. Possible in large part by [the r/CryptoDevs community](https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptodevs/) and [the Official r/CryptoDevs Discord](https://discord.gg/EDA6M3R).

If you are looking for a more basic guide, please check [Consensys's Best Practices Repository](https://github.com/ConsenSys/smart-contract-best-practices) and [bkrem's Awesome Solidity Repository](https://github.com/bkrem/awesome-solidity), slightly more advanced information can also be found at the [BlockchainNZ's Awesome Solidity Repository](https://github.com/BlockchainLabsNZ/awesome-solidity).

If you're looking for more EVM related content, please check [Ethereum's EVM Awesome List](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-Virtual-Machine-(EVM)-Awesome-List) for a general listing of EVM tools and information.
